# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Coverage isn't part of the version of US Core we're complying with.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-41752
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-coverage').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Coverage derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# Device for CRD doesn't meet the constraints of Implantable Device.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29674
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# US Core MedicationRequest doesn't allow PractitionerRole as requester.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29667

# This identifier is intended to show that identifiers that *aren't* in one of the slices are also valid
INFORMATION: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/Practitioner/practitioner-1: Practitioner.identifier[1]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-practitioner|2.1.0-preview (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# There's no expectation that the example questionnaire would resolve
The questionnaire 'http://example.org/some-payer/Questionnaire/123|1.3.0' could not be resolved, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# These are example code systems, so no resolution is expected
A definition for CodeSystem 'https://example.org/some-organization/device-codes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://example.org/fhir/CodeSystem/SomeCodes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# Nothing we can do about this
The definition for the Code System with URI 'https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# This example intentionally uses text rather than a code and the concept represented can't be expressed in the value set
WARNING: Binary/CRDServiceResponse: CDSHooksResponse.systemActions[0].resource/*ServiceRequest/idfromcontext*/.extension[0].extension[6].value.ofType(CodeableConcept): No code provided, and a code should be provided from the value set 'CRD Coverage Assertion Reasons' (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/ValueSet/coverageAssertionReasons|2.1.0-cibuild)

# This is indeed a large value set and it's ok that the expansion doesn't show everything
INFORMATION: ValueSet.where(id = 'orderDetail'): The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
