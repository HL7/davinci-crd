# In https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Inter-IG.20link.20issue, confirmed this is a US Core 7 issue - nothing we can do about it.
%The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU7/servicerequest-example-di.html' for "CT Scan example" cannot be resolved

# This *is* referenced.  Tooling is incorrectly reporting this warning.  Raised on Zulip - lloyd add link
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/CDSHookServiceResponseExtensionAssociatedResource'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this data type profile

# This link is intended to be version-independent
%The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd' for "Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)" is a canonical link and is therefore unsafe with regard to versions

# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Device for CRD doesn't meet the constraints of Implantable Device.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29674
