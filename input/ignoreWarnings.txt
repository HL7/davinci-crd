A summary of all such conformance statements found in this implementation guide can be found here.'
INFORMATION: en/foundation.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'The authors of this IG acknowledge that this may limit the payer from providing full responses to all calls where a response is theoretically possible. Systems should provide the best information they can in a timely fashion and rely on other layers of the payment and adjudication process to catch issues that require longer processing. For example, if a system is able to provide a response on eligibility within the time window, but not on whether prior authorization is needed, it can return cards indicating the service is covered, but that DTR is needed (to determine prior authorization requirements). A determination that additional information is needed (e.g., via DTR) is considered to be a valid response. Where a CRD server responds with a coverage information extension indicating doc-needed of 'clinical', 'admin', or 'patient' and the payer supports DTR, the responsible organization SHOULD support soliciting the identified additional information via DTR. This expectation is intended to change to 'SHALL' in a future release.'
INFORMATION: en/foundation.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'The expectation of CRD is that CRD servers SHOULD query all data necessary to make their coverage determination decisions if that data is available for query in the EHR and that data is not returned in prefetch.  Coverage determination decisions are whether the service is covered, whether prior authorization is required, and whether additional information needs to be gathered.  It is not acceptable for a CRD server to rely exclusively on DTR as a mechanism to retrieve data.  DTR is for data retrieval that requires human intervention or review.  There may be circumstances where time constraints prevent all needed data from being retrieved, in which case DTR retrieval of data that would not typically need human review may be necessary.  However, this should never be the design objective.  This query requirement may be tightened to 'SHALL' in a future release.'

INFORMATION: en/implementation.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'Key aspects of interoperability for this specification include agreement on how to identify payers, identify different types of coverage, etc. As yet, there is no industry-wide solution to this issue. However, HL7 is working with industry partners on viable solutions to these issues. Guidance and recommendations on how to manage consistent identity of payer concepts as well as other topics can be found in the CRD Implementer Support confluence page. Some of the guidance there may migrate to this specification and become 'SHALL' in future releases, so implementers are strongly encouraged to align with the guidance on the page in their early development.'
INFORMATION: en/metrics.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'Each of these IGs recommends a set of metrics that SHOULD or MAY be collected by their respective implementations to facilitate the evaluation of adoption, functionality, processes, and improved outcomes. While there are current and proposed state requirements for prior authorization metric reporting, at the time of publication there is no requirement to report on the metrics defined here.  However, it is reasonable to believe that in the future interested entities (providers, payers, regulators, quality organizations, certification agencies, states, etc.) will ask for these metrics to evaluate the ongoing automation of the supported processes / exchanges. While this guide will not require these metrics to be captured in this release, the authors strongly recommend that each implementation do so with the expectation that collection and dissemination of these metrics may become a requirement ('SHALL') in future version of these IGs.'
INFORMATION: en/operational.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'CRD clients and servers SHOULD support encounter-start and order-select, both to allow payer caching and to allow payers to return useful responses when possible (e.g. coverage expired, service not covered) with the limited information available in those hooks.  Requirements for either or both hook might be tightened to 'SHALL' in a future release of this specification.'

WARNING: DA VINCI: The How to Read page (background.html) needs to include a reference to the http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/actordefinition.html because this IG uses the actordefinition resource.

# 22. X12 Code Systems and Value Sets that are referenced in the guide but not freely available
A definition for CodeSystem 'https://codesystem.x12.org/005010/1365' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
No definition could be found for URL value 'https://codesystem.x12.org/005010/1365'
ERROR: ValueSet.where(id = 'X12ServiceType'): Error from https://tx.fhir.org/r4: Error: A definition for CodeSystem 'https://codesystem.x12.org/005010/1365' could not be found, so the value set cannot be expanded

# 23. These repetitions are not expected to match any slices
INFORMATION: Practitioner/full: Practitioner.identifier[0]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-practitioner|2.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
INFORMATION: ServiceRequest/example: ServiceRequest.reasonCode[0].coding[0]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-servicerequest|2.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# 24. **[New] These are from real-world examples, so the status isn't a concern
The concept '0093-0948' has a status of inactive and its use should be reviewed
The concept '59011-410' has a status of inactive and its use should be reviewed

# 25. **[Updated approval status] All terminology with the exception of two value sets has been moved into THO.  Those have THO proposals - one approved (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-668), one not (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-782).  The not-yet approved one is for internal IG use, not implementer use.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
