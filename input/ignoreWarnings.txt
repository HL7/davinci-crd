Coverage determination decisions are whether the service is covered, whether prior authorization is required, and whether additional information needs to be gathered.  It is not acceptable for a CRD server to rely exclusively on DTR as a mechanism to retrieve data.  DTR is for data retrieval that requires human intervention or review.  There may be circumstances where time constraints prevent all needed data from being retrieved, in which case DTR retrieval of data that would not typically need human review may be necessary.  However, this should never be the design objective.  This query requirement may be tightened to 'SHALL' in a future release.'
INFORMATION: en/foundation.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'The authors of this IG acknowledge that this may limit the payer from providing full responses to all calls where a response is theoretically possible. Systems should provide the best information they can in a timely fashion and rely on other layers of the payment and adjudication process to catch issues that require longer processing. For example, if a system is able to provide a response on eligibility within the time window, but not on whether prior authorization is needed, it can return cards indicating the service is covered, but that DTR is needed (to determine prior authorization requirements). A determination that additional information is needed (e.g., via DTR) is considered to be a valid response. Where a CRD server responds with a coverage information extension indicating doc-needed of 'clinical', 'admin', or 'patient' and the payer supports DTR, the responsible organization SHOULD support gathering the additional information via DTR. This expectation is intended to change to 'SHALL' in a future release.'
INFORMATION: en/implementation.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'Key aspects of interoperability for this specification include agreement on how to identify payers, identify different types of coverage, etc. As yet, there is no industry-wide solution to this issue. However, HL7 is working with industry partners on viable solutions to these issues. Guidance and recommendations on how to manage consistent identity of payer concepts as well as other topics can be found in the CRD Implementer Support confluence page. Some of the guidance there may migrate to this specification and become 'SHALL' in future releases, so implementers are strongly encouraged to align with the guidance on the page in their early development.'
INFORMATION: en/metrics.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'Each of these IGs recommends a set of metrics that SHOULD or MAY be collected by their respective implementations to facilitate the evaluation of adoption, functionality, processes, and improved outcomes. While there are current and proposed state requirements for prior authorization metric reporting, at the time of publication there is no requirement to report on the metrics defined here.  However, it is reasonable to believe that in the future interested entities (providers, payers, regulators, quality organizations, certification agencies, states, etc.) will ask for these metrics to evaluate the ongoing automation of the supported processes / exchanges. While this guide will not require these metrics to be captured in this release, the authors strongly recommend that each implementation do so with the expectation that collection and dissemination of these metrics may become a requirement ('SHALL') in future version of these IGs.'
INFORMATION: en/operational.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'CRD clients and servers SHOULD support encounter-start and order-select, both to allow payer caching and to allow payers to return useful responses when possible (e.g. coverage expired, service not covered) with the limited information available in those hooks.  Requirements for either or both hook might be tightened to 'SHALL' in a future release of this specification.'
