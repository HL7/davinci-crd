# 4. This link is intended to be version-independent
%The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd' for "Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)" is a canonical link and is therefore unsafe with regard to versions

# 5. Device for CRD doesn't meet the constraints of Implantable Device.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29674
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

A definition for CodeSystem 'https://example.org/some-organization/device-codes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://example.org/fhir/CodeSystem/SomeCodes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# 7. This is a terminology server limitation

# 11. We're inheriting the use of these extensions from the core spec
