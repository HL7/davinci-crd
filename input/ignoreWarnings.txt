WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/CDSHookServiceResponseExtensionAssociatedResource'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this data type profile

# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
