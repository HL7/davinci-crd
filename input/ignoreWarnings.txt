# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Device for CRD doesn't meet the constraints of Implantable Device.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29674
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process
