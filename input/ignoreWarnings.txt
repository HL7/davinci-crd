# The underlying code systems are marked as content=example in THO.  Have submitted https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-451 to fix this.  Have manually verified that the codes exist and display names are correct
WARNING: Appointment/example: Appointment.serviceCategory[0]: The system http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-category was found but did not contain enough information to properly validate the code "17" ("General Practice") (mode = example)
WARNING: Appointment/example: Appointment.serviceType[0]: The system http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-type was found but did not contain enough information to properly validate the code "124" ("General Practice") (mode = example)

# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Coverage isn't part of the version of US Core we're complying with.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-41752
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-coverage').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Coverage derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# Device for CRD doesn't meet the constraints of Implantable Device.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29674
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-device').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# US Core MedicationRequest doesn't allow PractitionerRole as requester.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-29667
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-medicationrequest').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on MedicationRequest derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# ServiceRequest doesn't exist in the version of US-Core we're using, so can't derive from it.  See US Core Ticket FHIR-41737
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-servicerequest').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on ServiceRequest derive from the core US profile.

# This identifier is intended to show that identifiers that *aren't* in one of the slices are also valid
INFORMATION: Practitioner/example: Practitioner.identifier[1]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/StructureDefinition/profile-practitioner|2.0.1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# There's no expectation that the example questionnaire would resolve
The questionnaire 'http://example.org/some-payer/Questionnaire/123|1.3.0' could not be resolved, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# These are example code systems, so no resolution is expected
A definition for CodeSystem 'https://example.org/some-organization/device-codes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://example.org/fhir/CodeSystem/SomeCodes' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# Nothing we can do about this
The definition for the Code System with URI 'https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# This example intentionally uses text rather than a code and the concept represented can't be expressed in the value set
WARNING: Binary/CRDServiceResponse: CDSHooksResponse.systemActions[0].resource/*ServiceRequest/idfromcontext*/.extension[0].extension[6].value.ofType(CodeableConcept): No code provided, and a code should be provided from the value set 'CRD Coverage Assertion Reasons' (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/ValueSet/coverageAssertionReasons|2.1.0-cibuild)
