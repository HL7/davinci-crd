# The remaining errors are all tooling issues:
# - All issues related to extension-CommunicationRequest.payload.content related to an issue raised on Zulip here: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/URL.20for.20R5.20pre-adoption.20extension
# - 'The link 'history.html' for "History" cannot be resolved' is a long-standing tooling issue
# - 'Code System URI 'urn:iso:std:iso:3166' is unknown so the code cannot be validated' - this issue disappears if you delete the txcache, but promptly re-appears against
# - Issues related to igpublisher-spreadsheet relate to a template issue not suppressing the extension - or to the publisher not recognizing it.  It's essential for template operation
# - 'Coverage.text: max allowed = 0' and 'Patient.text: max allowed = 0' stem from there being no means to prevent the publisher from generating narrative for specific files
# - 'The URL http://example.org/Questionnaire/XYZ|2 is not valid (URL contains Invalid Characters ([|]))' is raised here: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Narrative.20creation.20isn't.20handling.20versioned.20canonicals.20well
