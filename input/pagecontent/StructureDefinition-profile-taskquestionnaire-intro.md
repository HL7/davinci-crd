### Usage
<br/>
This profile on Task allows a response CDS Hook Card to request a user to fill out a Questionnaire (pointed to as a Task.input).  It supports the process described in the [Deferring Card Actions](cards.html#request-form-completion-response-type) portion of the spec.

Information provided in [Must Support]({{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html#mustsupport) elements will commonly be required for CRD Servers to perform coverage requirements discovery.
