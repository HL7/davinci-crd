### Notes
While the codes for the medication are expected to be drawn from RxNorm, EHRs **MAY** send additional coding repetions to communicate other code systems (e.g., HCPCS J codes).  This may be necessary for the payer to appropriately  respond to coverage information regarding medications associated with medical and DME benefits.
