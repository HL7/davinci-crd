<p>
This extension is added to FHIR Reqeust and other resources as part of the CRD <a href="cards.html#coverage-information">Coverage Information Response Type</a>.
</p>

<p>
The process of describing the applicable coverage rules for a given product or service can be complex, so this extension includes
quite a few components.
</p>

<p>
The primary purposes of this extension is to convey three things:
<ol>
  <ul></ul>
</ol>
At minimum, the extension will identify the patient coverage the coverage assertion applies to and
a determination of coverage.  Determinations of whether prior authorization is necessary <b>SHOULD</b> be included unless the decision is that the product or service is not covered.  if there is a
decision or additional documentation is necessary
