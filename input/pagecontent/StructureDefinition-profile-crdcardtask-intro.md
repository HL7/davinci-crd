### Usage
<br/>
This profile on Task allows a response CDS Hook Card to store a Task in an CRD client allowing one or more of the other actions in the card to be stored in the CRD client to be acted on later.  It supports the process described in the [Deferring Card Actions](foundation.html#deferring-card-actions) portion of the spec.

Information provided in [Must Support]({{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html#mustsupport) elements will commonly be required for CRD Servers to perform coverage requirements discovery.
