### Introduction

CRD clients **SHALL** use this element to convey likely billing codes if they are known, but are not required to know billing codes (e.g. if ordering and performing systems will differ).  CRD servers **SHALL NOT** depend on this element being present in order to provide a response.  If codes are provided with this extension, CRD servers **SHALL** consider any codes provided and **MAY** consider additional codes determined by their own mapping when returning coverage information responses.
