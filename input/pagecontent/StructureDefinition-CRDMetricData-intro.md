This model is NOT a FHIR data structure for information exchange.  Instead, it is a logical model of the information that ought to be collected and maintained for each CRD transaction.  While implementers may choose any internal storage format that is appropriate for their system, the information collected should ultimately be mapped to the information model below.  

Mapping implementation data to these elements will allow metrics (see the table on the [metrics page](metrics.html)) to be represented in a way that provides consistent responses to requirements from various interested parties (providers, payers, regulators, quality organizations, certification agencies, states, etc.) by each of the participants in the CRD exchanges.
