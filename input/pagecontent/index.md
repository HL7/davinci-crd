<blockquote class="note-to-balloters">
<p>Welcome to the ballot for the STU 2.2 release of CRD.</p>

<p>This release contains many changes requested by the implementer community.  Most of them are non-significant or backwards compatible changes, but there are a few that could at least be theoretically breaking for some implementations and there are a few that will be breaking for all implementations.  A complete list of the changes for this ballot, as well as links to the tracker items that provide justification for them can be found <a href="history.html#release-220-ballot">here</a></p>

<p>Not all issues raised against the specification are resolved prior to this ballot.  There are a few issues that call into question some of the fundamental design approaches associated with the guide.  The community has been engaged in deep discussions about these issues and feedback from the community is sought by the community about the issues raised.  It is possible that changes resulting from some of these issues could be incorporated in the publication that results from these issues.  A list of the issues, considerations around the issues, and associated Jira tickets may be found <a href="issues.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This ballot also includes notes related to two Jira issues that are not fully reflected in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="termnote"> </a>
<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-50276">FHIR-50276</a> updates the guide to adhere to an HL7 policy requiring a transition of code systems from 'temporary' codes to official codes maintained outside of the implementation guide now that the requirements are more stable.  The proposals to add the official codes are not yet available but will be before the publication of the guide.  Once they are available, the guide will be updated to have <b>two</b> bindings for the relevant data elements, requiring both the old and new codes to be present.  This will provide a transition path for those using older versions of the specification.  Support for the temporary codes will be phased out in a future release.  The specific value sets impacted are: <a href="ValueSet-coverageAssertionReasons.html">Coverage Assertion Reasons</a> and <a href="ValueSet-coverageDetail.html">CRD Coverage Detail Codes</a> (used in the <a href="StructureDefinition-ext-coverage-information.html">Coverage Information extension</a> <a href="ValueSet-cardType.html">CRD Card Types</a> (used in the <a href="deviations.html#new-hook-configuration-mechanism">CRD configuration</a> mechanism), and <a href="ValueSet-cmslocationcodes.html">CMS Location Codes</a> (used in the <a href="StructureDefinition-profile-location.html">CRD Location profile</a>), 
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-50814">FHIR-50814</a> - as part of improving the validation process to catch the identified issues (and others), there is work to define a set of computable representations for the CRD-specific CDS Hooks request and response models.  Tooling issues are currently preventing this set of representations from being complete (and thus actually performing validation).  If these tooling issues are addressed prior to publication, then computable representations of CRD-specific constraints will be included in the IG.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> The scope of this ballot is limited to the above changes and to feedback about the issues linked to above.  While feedback can always be submitted against any content in the specification at any time, votes submitted against content that is outside the official scope of the ballot may be deemed 'not related' and therefore not able to support negative votes.

### Overview
<a name="FHIR-48553"> </a>
<p class="modified-content">The process of billing a patient's insurance provider is complex and costly, particularly in the United States. Healthcare providers work with a range of payers who provide coverage for the products and clinical services provided to patients. Each payer offers distinct insurance plans for healthcare products and services, and each has its own unique process to determine whether each service is necessary and appropriate. These processes have many different requirements for documentation, prior authorization, or other approval steps. Claims submitted for payment that do not meet payer requirements will typically be denied, which may result in service delay, resubmission, or appeal. These delays and additional processes may result in negative health outcomes or financial costs for patients, as well as financial and productivity losses for providers.</p>

This Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) implementation guide defines a workflow in which a payer makes coverage requirement information available to a healthcare provider within the provider's software system at the point of care where treatment decisions are made. This will help clinicians and administrative staff make informed recommendations to their patients and meet payer submission requirements. 

This implementation guide supports both Protected Health Information (PHI)-specific and non-PHI mechanisms for CRD to meet the needs and privileges of different payer organizations.  These mechanisms will allow payers to share a wide variety of information with providers in a context-sensitive manner including:

* updates to coverage information
* alternative (e.g. first-line, lower-cost, etc.) services or products
* documentation requirements and rules related to coverage
* forms and templates to complete
* indications of whether a therapy is covered and if prior authorization is required, including propagating this information into the relevant order/appointment

This implementation guide is designed to allow for initial support of basic capabilities and to subsequently build new features over time.

<blockquote class="stu-note" markdown="1">
<p>
The scope of this specification has increased to also support prior authorization process earlier in the workflow by allowing prior authorization to be returned during the CRD interaction.  Specifically:</p>

<p>On Feb 28, 2024, the Office of Burden Reduction and Health Informatics (OBRHI) National Standards Group (NSG) announced an <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/discretion-x12-278-enforcement-guidance-letter-remediated-2024-02-28.pdf">enforcement discretion</a> that they would not enforce the requirement to use the X12 278 for prior authorization if the covered entities were using the FHIR-based Prior Authorization API as described in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization final rule (CMS-0057-F). This allows payers to return a prior authorization number for use in the X12 837 in coverage extension of the CRD and DTR IGs or as part of the all-FHIR exchange of the Prior Authorization Response Bundle in the PAS IG.  For CRD, this specifically means that the satisfied-pa-id in the <a href="StructureDefinition-ext-coverage-information.html">Coverage Information extension</a> can be used as an X12 prior authorization number.</p>
</blockquote>

### Systems
This implementation guide sets expectations for two types of systems:

CRD clients are typically systems that healthcare providers use at the point of care, including electronic medical records systems, pharmacy systems, and other provider and administrative systems used for ordering, documenting, and executing patient-related services. Users of these systems need coverage requirements information to support care planning.

Examples of potential CRD clients include EHRs, EMRs, practice management systems, scheduling systems, patient registration systems, etc.  

The CRD client may actually involve multiple systems. For example, the systems that handle order entry may be different from what is used for appointment booking and different again from the system that exposes information over the FHIR interface. It is possible that a provider environment might use an intermediary to coordinate CRD client calls from multiple systems. Such an architecture is sufficient provided that:

* Calls are triggered from within the system the user is interacting with at the time when the 'hook event' (entering an order, booking an appointment, etc.) occurs.
* Cards returned are displayed to the user, or in the event of system actions, user-notifications associated with the system actions are presented to the user within the same application.
* The 'access token' and FHIR endpoint exposed to the CRD service has access to all relevant data, independent of which physical data store it resides.
* The intermediary could take responsibility for the FHIR interface, such as determining which payer should receive a coverage request.

There are three distinct sets of capabilities for CRD clients, one for [USCDI v1 (US-Core 3.1.1)](CapabilityStatement-crd-client3.1.html), one for [USCDI v3 (US-Core 6.1.0)](CapabilityStatement-crd-client6.1.html), and one for [USCDI v4 (US-Core 7.0.0)](CapabilityStatement-crd-client7.0.html).  Typically, a client would support only one of these, based on which US Core release the client supports internally.  There is a single CRD server set of capabilities which must be able to handle data from any of the three supported USCDI versions.

<blockquote class="stu-note">
<p>
When CRD clients are made up of multiple systems, there will be orchestration requirements to allow each system to interact in a way that together they appear as a single monolithic system from the perspective of the CRD server. This IG provides some discussion of this on the <a href="epa.html">electronic prior authorization (ePA) Coordinators page</a>, though it does not yet provide any standardization about how components should interoperate to achieve the intended monolithic behavior. If there is industry interest, future releases of this IG may work to standardize some of these "intra-client" interactions.
</p>

CRD servers (or servers) are systems that act on behalf of payer organizations to share information with healthcare providers about rules and requirements related to healthcare products and services covered by a patient's health plan. A CRD server will provide coverage information related to one or more insurance plans. CRD servers are a type of CDS service as defined in the CDS Hooks Specification.

There are is a single [set of capabilities for CRD servers](CapabilityStatement-crd-server.html) that spans USCDI v1 (US-Core 3.1.1) USCDI v3 (US-Core 6.1.0), and USCDI v4 (US-Core 7.0.0) expectations.  Payers will need to handle content from any of the releases, as CRD clients will be transitioning support for the versions at different times - and in some cases may provide content that spans a mixture of versions.

### Dependencies
This guide is based on the [FHIR R4]({{site.data.fhir.path}}) specification that is mandated for use in the U.S. as well as the [CDS Hooks 2.0]({{site.data.fhir.ver.cdshooks}}) and [CDS Hooks CI Build](https://cds-hooks.org/specification/current/) releases of the CDS Hooks specification.  It also leverages the [SMART on FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch) specification for CRD clients that opt to use that approach for "what-if" scenarios.

In addition, this guide also relies on several ancestor implementation guides:
