This page lists considerations and recommendations for implementation that fall outside the conformance expectations established by the specification.  I.e. It covers content that the specification authors and project team consider to be essential business practices, good ideas, as well as concepts worthy of consideration/awareness.  However, the content here doesn't define specific testable behavior.

### Suppressing Guidance
Some CRD clients might suppress certain types of payer guidance as being the 'default' presumption.  E.g. "Covered, no prior authorization required".  Where CRD systems do this, there may be an issue if the CRD service becomes unable to respond and the EHR does not clearly flag to the user that the service is not available.  I.e. Providers may incorrectly presume that authorization is not needed.  Clients that perform such suppression of messages **SHALL** mitigate this potential for misinterpretation.
